 It is not set on stone, but your pull-requests have more chance to get clearance if you follow some simple rules.

5. How does NodeOS compare to other OSes on how to do daily tasks?

 If you know Linux, you get used with some standard ways of doing things.
For example, you know that to manage a service you go for "/etc/init.d/CoolStuff" script or
issue "service CoolStuff status" command.
 NodeOS have some default places for OS programs and some distinct way of doing things as well:

- To install pragrams use npm (Node Package Manager)
-- ie. npm install vtop 
- System programs goes in "/.../bin/"
- User space programs goes in "/.../bin/"
- To start a service do a "node ..."
- To know a program is running do a "ps ..."


6. What are the default system services on NodeOS and how they interact with each other?

- Davius (piranna/Davius)
-- Webdav implementation 
-- Listens on port 80
-- Resides at /lib/node_modules/Davius
-- Interacts with nodeos-reverse-proxy by ...

- nodeos-reverse-proxy (piranna/nodeos-reverse-proxy)
-- Reverse proxy implementation
-- ...
