# HACK `npm` add all the binaries to the `node_modules/.bin` folder without
# matter what package installed it, so `env` from `usrbinenv` gets available on
# the `$PATH` during build process, making it to fail since its shebang is
# `#!/bin/node`, that's only valid on NodeOS, so we need to remove the symlink
# to make it not interfere with the build process
