# NodeOS

Lightweight operating system using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) as userspace.

NodeOS is an operating system build entirely in Javascript and managed by
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com). Any package in `npm` is a NodeOS package, which at
last count was 301,660 packages. The goal of NodeOS is to provide just enough to
let `npm` provide the rest. Since anyone can contribute to it, anyone can create
NodeOS packages.

This project won the spanish [9th National Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1415)
on the Systems category and was Honorable Mention of its [10th edition](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1516).
It was also presented as the degree thesis of [Jes√∫s Leganes Combarro](https://github.com/piranna)
with a qualification of 10/10 with distinction.

## Introduction

NodeOS is a Node.js based operating system, built-off of the Linux kernel.
The NodeOS Project is aiming to, and can already run on some of the following
platforms:

- **real hardware** like desktops, laptops, or SoC's (Raspberry Pi)
- **cloud providers** like Joyent, Amazon or Rackspace
- **virtual machines** like QEmu, VirtualBox, VMWare and KVM
- **PaaS providers** like Heroku or Joyent's Manta
- **container providers** like Docker & Vagga

Core development is being done in layers. There could be some differences to
adjust better to each target platform, but the general structure is:

- *barebones* custom Linux kernel with an initramfs that boots to a Node.js REPL
- *initramfs* Initram environment to mount the users partition & boot the system
- *rootfs*    Read-only partition image to host Linux kernel and initramfs files
- *usersfs*   multi-user environment with the same behaviour of traditional OSes

### Booting process

All the layers are bootable, leading *barebones* to a raw naked Node.js
[REPL](http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) prompt as PID 1, while *initramfs* (and
by extension *rootfs*) exec actual NodeOS code to mount the *usersfs* partition.
In all the cases, it will be used an initramfs as root filesystem and all the
changes will be lost when powered-off.

If a *usersfs* partition is being set at boot time, it will be mounted and the
system will considerate each one of its folders as the home folder for a valid
user on the system, and will execute a `init` file in the root of each of them.
If found, `root` user will be the first to be considerated and will have access
to all the home directories, but by design it will not be possible to elevate
permissions once the system has booted.

### Hacking

If you are hacking on NodeOS as a somewhat production server, you are likely
building *usersfs* images since each user is isolated of others, but you can be
able to customize all layers. For example, you could be able to modify
*initramfs* to login the users and mount their home folders from a cloud service
or craft a system without global services (no `root` user) or also dedicate a
full NodeOS instance to a single Node.js application.


# Pre-built Images

Ready to use [pre-build images](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/releases) are
automatically generated after each commit in master branch that sucessfully
[pass the tests](https://semaphoreapp.com/nodeos/nodeos). To exec them, you'll
need to have [QEmu](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) installed on your system.

The *iso* can be written to a CD-R or flashed to an USB pendrive, but will only
provide the read-only rootfs and the changes will be done in memory loosing them
after reboot, so you'll need to set manually a read-write usersfs partition if
you want to persist them. On the other hand, if you want to flash it to an USB
pendrive, it's recomended to do it by using `bin/installUSB` command so it will
create automatically a read-write usersfs partition to fill the remaining space
so your changes will persist.

# Build NodeOS in five steps

1. Download the project source code:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:NodeOS/NodeOS.git
   cd NodeOS
   ```

2. Install the required build tools, on a Ubuntu based system you can do it by
   executing

   ```bash
   sudo bin/install-dependencies
   ```

3. Install NodeOS build dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
  ```

3. Build NodeOS:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

   By default it will generate some files that can be used with QEmu, compiled
   for your current machine architecture. You can be able to configure the build
   process by passing some environment variables. For example, to force to build
   for 32 bits, use `PLATFORM=qemu_32 npm install` instead.

4. Pick some microwave pop-corn and go to see a movie. No, really, do it.

5. Exec your fresh compiled NodeOS image:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   It will automatically detect what CPU architecture will need to be used on
   QEmu and exec the correct emulation.

...and profit! :-D

If you encounter an error when building NodeOS, take a look at

open an [issue](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues).

# NodeOS on LXC containers (Docker and vagga)

Currently LXC containers support is unmaintained due to the inability to mount
filesystems from inside them. There are some NodeOS images on Docker Hub, but
they are totally outdated. If you are interested in help or testing, you can
build them from source code.

## Quick Start

1. [Install Docker](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/)
2. One Liner

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -t -i nodeos/nodeos
   ```

   or learn how to make a [Custom Build](http://node-os.com/blog/get-involved/)

## Build from Source

*Warning*: the build process is hairy, it probably won't work the first time.
I'm working on that.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS.git
cd NodeOS
PLATFORM=docker npm install
```
